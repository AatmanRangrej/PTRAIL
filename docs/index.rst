PTRAIL: A Parallel Trajectory dAta preprocessIng Library
========================================================

Introduction
============

PTRAIL is a state-of-the art Mobility Data Preprocessing
Library that mainly deals with filtering data, generating
features and interpolation of Trajectory Data.

The main features of PTRAIL are:
    1. PTRAIL use primarily parallel computation based
       on python Pandas and numpy which makes it very fast
       as compared to other comparable libraries available.
    2. PTRAIL harnesses the full power of the machine
       that it is running on by using all the cores available
       in the computer.
    3. Four different kinds of Trajectory Interpolation
       techniques are offered by PTRAIL which is
       a first in the community.
