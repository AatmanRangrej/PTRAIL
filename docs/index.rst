NumMobility: A Mobility Data PreProcessing Library
==================================================

Introduction
============

NumMobility is a state-of-the art Mobility Data Preprocessing
Library that mainly deals with filtering data, generating
features and interpolation of Trajectory Data.

The main features of NumMobility are:
    1. NumMobility use primarily parallel computation based
       on python Pandas and numpy which makes it very fast
       as compared to other comparable libraries available.
    2. NumMobility harnesses the full power of the machine
       that it is running on by using all the cores available
       in the computer.
    3. Four different kinds of Trajectory Interpolation
       techniques are offered by NumMobility which is
       a first in the community.
